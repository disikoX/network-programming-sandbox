# network-programming-sandbox

Bunch of codes I'll write in `Go`, `Python`, and `C++` for fun and better understanding of some network principles.

To be covered (The content may change as the project goes on) : 

- [ ] Socket Level Programming

- [ ] Application Level Programming
    - [ ] HTTP Clients
    - [ ] HTTP Services

## Socket Level Programming

I have used the book [Network Programming with C++]( https://github.com/ikoHSE/Books-1/blob/master/C%2B%2B/C%2B%2B%20Network%20Programming%20Volume%201.pdf") for `C++` code.
